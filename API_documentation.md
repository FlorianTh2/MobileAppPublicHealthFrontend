# API Documentation
Frontend-Project for Mobile-App in the area of Public Health. This project just consists of a Frontend-Project. No Backend-Project was needed.
APIs are programmed products or products consisting of machine-readable code. The API documentation is also  called 'technical documentation'. The most important aspect of technical documentation is the usability of content and form, which is also referred to as usability. Usability can be achieved through the user-centered design of content, among other things. This is the content and purpose of this file.

## Tests

### General tests

#### Usability Tests:

Usability Test is already done with 5 people. It was noticeable that (for the future) we would need a UI/UX Designer to revice the Design. 
The users liked the structure very much. The structure was considered understandable and logical.
